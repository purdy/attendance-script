# Youth Missing Report Generator

This is a simple utility script to tie together data from a couple of directories and then the overall *People* sheet from the *2019-2020 Youth Directory* Google Sheet.

To run the program, you need to download this repo and then setup some CSV files:

 * 2018-directory.csv: Once you have this file setup, you probably will never need to update it again.
 * 2019-directory.csv: Once you have this file setup, you probably will never need to update it again (unless there are any changes to the Student Info Form Data Collection sheet).
 * youth-attendance.csv: This is the file that changes every week. You go to the *2019-2020 Youth Directory* Google Sheet and select the *People* sheet at the bottom and then select *Download* and then *Comma Separated Values (.csv, current sheet)*. That will download the .csv file and you will need to move it into place, wherever you setup this repo.
